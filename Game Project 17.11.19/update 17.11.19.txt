i've created a function called iscollision where you have 4 cordinates two of enemy and two of bullet.
i've used all of these four cordinates in this formula the distance formula
then i managed to execute this formula inside my code.
i imported the math library and used 
"math.sqrt + math.pow"
using the power function we squared it just like the math distance formula.

if distance <27
the number 27 was tested and found as proper number for distance between
enemy and bullet to call it a collision if the number is less it will return true.
 

def isCollision(enemyX,enemyY,bulletX,bulletY):
    distance = math.sqrt((math.pow(enemyX-bulletX,2)) + (math.pow(enemyY-bulletY,2)))
    if distance < 27:
        return True
    else:
        return False

   # collision
    collision = isCollision(enemyX,enemyY,bulletX,bulletY)
    if collision:
        bulletY = 480
        bullet_state = "ready"
        score += 1
        print(score)
        enemyX = random.randint(0,735)
        enemyY = random.randint(50,150)
